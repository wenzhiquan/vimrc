### My vim config

```sh
curl -L bit.ly/1Ac5ZEw|sh (not in China or VPN)
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxxdn/vimrc/master/install.sh|sh (in China without VPN)
```

Then launch vim and tap the following command
```sh
:PluginInstall
```

The only thing difficult is to install YouCompleteMe(Autocomplet plugin)
